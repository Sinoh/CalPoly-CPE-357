1. Which machine did you choose?
    I installed ubuntu 18.04 on my personal computer

2. Which manual page did you read? Did you learn anything useful?
    I read the “intro 1” page. It mainly helped me review most of the commands. Commands like “cat” and “grep” are ones I use, but I never learned exactly their definitions were until now.

3. Which editor did you choose? Why? (Some people feel very strongly about
their editors. . . )
    I am using Vim because I feel more comfortable about using Vim than Emacs.

4. Please include a copy of your program in this submission. Did you encounter
any problems while developing it? If so, what were they and how did you solve
them?
    Program wise, I only ran into syntax errors because I need to get familiar
with vim. I solved them by just double checking my code. I had way more trouble getting
ubuntu set up.
